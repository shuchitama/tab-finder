# Tab-finder

https://tab-finder.herokuapp.com/

This app allows a guitar learner to search by chords that they know how to play, and get back a list of songs that they can play with just the chords they know.

This project was created and published by me and [Mariana](https://github.com/maridoh13) as part of our learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Project setup

The database used to run this app is accessed from this URL: https://tab-finder-api.herokuapp.com/

To run the app, use the following commands:

- To run the API server, type `npm start` from inside the tab-finder-api directory
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
